### Hi there 👋

My name is Coralie Delpha. I live in London, UK. I'm passionate about entrepreneurship and building all kinds of tools, both online and offline.

### Work

After being a Freelance Shopify developer for 5 years, I joined Shopify as a Lead Technical Architect in the Professional Services team. After almost 2 years in that role, I've changed teams to become an Internal Tool Builder in Shopify's Product Experience team.

As a side project, I write a [weekly newsletter](https://coraliedelpha.beehiiv.com/) about Shopify news, creative stories that inspire me and relaxing content to disconnect from work.
