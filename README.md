### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Coralie Delpha. I live in London, UK.

### About my work

After being a Freelance Shopify developer for 5 years, I recently joined Shopify as a Lead Technical Architect, as part of the Professional Services team.

As a side project, I write a [weekly newsletter](https://coraliedelpha.beehiiv.com/) about Shopify news, creative stories that inspire me and relaxing content to disconnect from work.
